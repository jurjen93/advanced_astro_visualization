### Details

With this repository you can make a **poster**, a **video**, or **interactive plot** of a FITS image. The scripts are written 
for **astronomy applications** but feel free to modify and use it for your own needs.
In the example we used the FITS file from LOFAR data.\

### Clone repo

You need to clone this repo with (in the location you want to have the scripts):\
```git clone https://github.com/jurjen93/advanced_astro_visualization.git```

### Install requirements

Go to ```advanced_astro_visualization``` with:\
```cd advanced_astro_visualization```\
Now you can install the requirements and make aliases to simplify commands with:\
```./setup.sh```\
If you get permission denied or access error, please give access with:\
```chmod u+x ./setup.sh```

### Catalogue csv file

You need to have a catalogue with sources for the poster (for the video it is optional). We have an example given in the
folder 'catalogue'.\
Use the following fields:

* ```source_id```   -> id of the source
* ```RA```          -> right ascension of the object
* ```DEC```         -> declination of the object
* ```size_x```      -> size on the x-axis of the object (in pixel or degree size)
* ```size_y```      -> size on the y-axis of the object (in pixel or degree size)
* ```imsize```      -> image size in degrees

### How to make the poster

First, download **Scribus**:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/scribus/files/scribus-devel/1.5.5/scribus-1.5.5-windows-x64.exe/download

Run now:\
```makeposter```\
where you can use the following flags

* ```-d``` -> Choose to download a specific fits file from the internet. Use ```1``` if you want to, leave empty
  otherwise.
* ```-csv``` -> Give a specific csv file with sources to include as cutouts in the poster.
* ```-fi``` -> Fits file to use. (If you don't download your fits file)

Example:\
```makeposter -csv catalogue/catalogue_lockman.csv -fi fits/lockman_hole.fits```

### How to make the video

Run:\
```makevideo```\
where you can use the following flags

* ```-d``` -> Choose to download a specific fits file from the internet. Use ```1``` if you want to, leave empty
  otherwise.
* ```-csv``` -> Give a specific csv file with sources to include as cutouts in the poster. If you leave it empty, it
  goes through the whole field.
* ```-fr``` -> Frame rate of the video. Advice is to use ```20``` to make the video smooth but doesn't take too long to
  record.
* ```-zs``` -> Size in degrees of the zoomed image. If the original image size is smaller than this input, there will be
  a zoom out.
* ```-dr``` -> The amount of degrees traversed each second ('degree rate') in the video.
* ```-fi``` -> Fits file to use. (If you don't download your fits file)
* ```-sc``` -> Scanning path type of a pan through the whole field. Can be ```'horizontal'``` or ```'spiral'```. New
  paths can be made with the ```paths.py``` script.

The user should be aware that with increasing -zs the -dr value should decrease in order to get a movie that scans
slowly over the image.
The -fr input then controls how smooth the video looks.

Example pan through source by source from your csv file:\
```makevideo -csv catalogue/catalogue_lockman.csv -d 1 -f 60```\
Example of pan through a whole field:\
```makevideo -fi fits/your_fits.fits```\
In the video one can see the coordinates. If you want to make a separate image from this, you can run the following:\
```makeimage -fi fits/your_fits.fits -ra 123.123 -dec 51.123 -si 0.4```\
where you can use the following flags

* ```-si``` -> Size in degrees.
* ```-dec``` -> Declination in degrees.
* ```-ra``` -> Right ascension in degrees.
* ```-fi``` -> Fits file to use.

### How to make the interactive plot

Run:\
```makeinteractive```\
where you can use the following flags

* ```-d``` -> Choose to download a specific fits file from the internet. Use ```1``` if you want to, leave empty
  otherwise.
* ```-fi``` -> Fits file to use. (If you don't download your fits file)

Example:\
```makeinteractive -fi fits/your_fits.fits```

### Output

**Poster**: *poster.pdf*\
**Video**: *movie.mp4*\
**Interactive plot**: *interactive.html*
